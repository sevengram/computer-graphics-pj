>> How to run?

$ make
$ ./dof


>> Tips

* Move the camera and change its parameters (focal length, f-stop and focus distance)
  to see the changes of depth of field.

* In auto focusing mode, the camera focuses on the object which is in the center of
  the view.

* Press F to show the focal range overlay. Red zone - focus point. Blue zone - focus range.
