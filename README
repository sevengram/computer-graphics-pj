>> Key bindings
  p/P        Toggle between orthogonal & perspective projections
  -/+        Decrease/increase light elevation
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

>> How to run?

$ make
$ ./dof

>> Proposed works and the Progresses

1. Create a scene containing multiple objects with lighting and textures. (Done)

OBJ files:
https://github.com/OpenGLInsights/OpenGLInsightsCode/tree/master/Chapter%2015%20Depth%20of%20Field%20with%20Bokeh%20Rendering/resources/models/tank


2. Post-processing effects (Done)

(1) Create a color texture and a depth texture
(2) Attach them to the framebuffer object (FBO).
(3) Render the scene to the color texture and render depth buffer to the depth texture.
(4) Pass the textures to the shader


3. DoF shader (Done)

4. Allow the user to change more parameters, such as the camera's focal length, aperture and focusing distance,
to see real-time DoF changes. (TODO)
